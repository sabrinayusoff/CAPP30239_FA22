    <p>Note: This is a very, very rough working draft of my final project, which I will pick back up
        after the break. I also just wanted to let you know that I changed the topic of my project and
        am now focusing on transport equity in Chicago. I will be examining the amount of time taken
        for residents in different parts of Chicago to travel to work, and see if there are any differences
        along socioeconomic status variables such as earnings.
