This folder contains the data that will be used for the final project. NOTE: The topic for my final project has changed to "Transport Equity in Chicago". The new data comes primarily from the American Community Survey: https://data.census.gov/table?q=s0802&g=0400000US17$8600000&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0802&moe=true&tp=false . All the data files are subsets of the full 2020 data: acs_commute_data_final.
