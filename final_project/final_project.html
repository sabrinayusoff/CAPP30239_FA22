        <p>
            Urban transportation is the lifeline of a city, providing its people with access to employment, medical services,
            and community and recreational opportunities. It impacts the lives of urban dwellers in many ways:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Mobility:</b> Transportation planning affects not only economic development in an area but also access
                    to economic opportunities across a city. It also impacts access to various services including medical
                    facilities, social and recreational activities, and basic necessities like food and education.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Quality of transportation services:</b> Residents' experiences of engaging with transportation infrastructure
                    directly influence their daily quality of life. Key factors affecting these experiences include traffic
                    congestion, safety on roads and public transit, and frequency of services.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Expenditure:</b> Transportation was the second-highest expenditure for American households in 2021,
                    with households spending an average of $10,961 on transportation (U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics,
                    <a href="www.bts.gov/product/transportation-economic-trends">Transportation Economic Trends</a>).
                    While households in the bottom
                    income quintile spend the least on transportation ($4,273 vs $19,204 by households in the highest income quintile),
                    they face a larger transportation cost burden, spending 26.9% of their after-tax income on transportation compared
                    to 10.4% by the highest income quintile. In 2021, almost a third of households in the bottom income quintile
                    ($0 to 24,127) do not own vehicles, and if they do, they own one vehicle per household on average.
                    This is in stark contrast to households in the top income quintile ($129,53 and above), of which 96% own a vehicle,
                    with an average of 2.7 private vehicles per household.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given its significant impacts on the lives of urban dwellers, equity is a primary concern in transportation planning.
            Specifically, public transit is an essential service for residents who do not own private vehicles and for whom
            access to economics opportunities is highly dependent on their mobility across the city. As such, equity is a particularly important priority
            for a sprawling city like Chicago where racial and
            socioeconomic disparities are aligned with geographic boundaries of neighborhoods.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project uses data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2020 to examine the modes of transportation taken to work by
            Chicago residents and the time taken to travel to work.
            It will compare zip codes in Chicago on these metrics, as well as on socioeconomic indicators, drawing observations about
            disparities in the role of public transportation in the lives of Chicagoans.

                    Majority of residents over 16 years old in Chicago who do not work from home travel to work by driving alone (58.48%),
                    and a large proportion take public transportation (31.82%). In comparison with other large cities in the US,

            <p>
                Consistent with stagnant population growth in the last decade
                (<a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Population+Total&g=1600000US1714000&tid=ACSDT5Y2020.B01003">ACS, data.census.gov</a>),
                CTA ridership has remained high, with an average total ridership of at least 1.5 million every year.
                A lack of downward trend in public transportation usage despite the rise in popularity of rideshare apps like Uber and Lyft
                suggests a continued reliance on public transportation, although whether by choice (which may signal satisfaction with the
                quality of public transit) or otherwise (due to alternatives of rideshare and private vehicle ownership being more costly) is not clear.

            <h3>But the picture may not be all that rosyâ€¦ 
                <br>
                <br>
                Neighborhoods in the South and North-West of Chicago have the longest public transportation commutes
                </h3>
            <p>
                Of those who commute to work by public transportation, residents living in neighborhoods that are farther
                away from downtown Chicago take much longer to travel to work. Notably, neighborhoods in the far South of Chicago
                have the longest commute times, taking more than 50 minutes to travel to work.
                <br>
                <br>
                Neighborhoods in the South are particularly disadvantaged as most of Chicagos jobs are concentrated in downtown
                and North Chicago, with 51.6% of private sector employment based in the central business district and outer business
                ring in 2020, and 28.9% located in the North, North West and West Central. In contrast, private sector work sites in the South,
                far South and South West of Chicago make up less than 20% of total private sector employment
                (<a href="https://ides.illinois.gov/resources/labor-market-information/where-workers-work.html">Illinois Department of Employment Security</a>).
                
                Hence, these residents not only face fewer job opportunities within their areas of residence, but also experience lower mobility
                in accessing employment in other parts of Chicago.

            These neighborhoods are also predominantly Black.
        </h3>
        <p>
            For example, zip codes 60620, 60628, 60619 have median earnings less than 80% of median earnings in Chicago in 2020
            ($43,827) (<a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=s0802&g=1600000US1714000&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0802&moe=true&tp=false">ACS, census.gov</a>).
            More than 15% of residents in these neighborhoods are below 100% of the poverty line, and more than 90% of these residents are Black.
            This highlights that disparities facing Black communities in Chicago extend far beyond employment, educational attainment, and income
            but also quality of life and physical mobility.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In all, Chicago has displayed high reliance on public transportation not only for work commutes but for everyday
                travel throughout the city. This preliminary analysis suggests some areas for improvement in the Chicago public
                transit system, namely, disparities in its services to communities in the South.
                Given the potentially indispensable role of public transit for low-income, Black communities,
                more consideration should be afforded to ensuring that these communities have access to efficient, reliable,
                affordable and extensive public transit options.

    <h2>Project Process</h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                After living in Chicago for more than a year and as someone who does not own a car, I have had first-hand experience
                navigating the Chicago public transit system to access various services around the city, so I thought it would be
                interesting to understand how the system is being used by the long-term residents in the city.
            </p>
        <h3>About the Data:</h3>
            <p>
                The data for this project comes primarily from the
                <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=s0802&g=0400000US17$8600000&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S0802&moe=true&tp=false">ACS 5-year estimates for 2020</a>.
                The ACS is an ongoing survey that gathers data on Americans' jobs, educational attainments and a wide range of topics
                including housing, income and demographic information. Given that this analysis uses fine-grained data on individual zipcodes
                in Chicago, I used 5-year estimates rather than 1-year estimates as they provide greater precision for analyzing very small populations.
                In this case, the estimates for 2020 are obtained from 2016-2020 data.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, CTA ridership data was obtained from the Chicago Data Portal. As the data came in the form of daily ridership,
                the data was aggregated by year and the annual averages were used in the analysis. 
            </p>
        <h3>About the Story:</h3>
            <p>
                The story was the most challenging part of this project as I did not initially approach the project with a strong story in
                mind and instead adopted a more exploratory approach so that towards the end of the project, there were not many strong conclusions
                I could make about the data. This highlights to me that the role of data visualization is ultimately to support the delivery of a
                story or message, and to provide a visual aid to the facts or observations made in the writing. In a real-world context, I imagine
                that this analysis > story > visualization process would occur more naturally, but this is a good reminder to take with me nonetheless.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of commute time to work, the ACS was the only dataset that I found that provides comprehensive demographic measures along
                with commute time and modes of transportation. To dig deeper into critiquing the Chicago public transit system, however, it would
                have been ideal to obtain data on performance measures on the CTA. While the CTA provides open access to its data on locations of bus
                stops and rail stops, as well as ridership data, it would have been interesting to look at data on delays and disruptions, especially
                in these post-pandemic times when there is a shortage of service staff.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, it would also have been interesting to see how the proportion of residents taking public transport changed
                between pre- and post-pandemic years, but it would have required much more data wrangling and analysis than time allowed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally, given that Chicago has the second-highest percentage of commuters riding their bikes to work
                (<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/facts.html">chicago.gov</a>),
                another area to explore is how other less common modes of commute like cycling and walking are used and how they differ
                across cities, comparing the level of walking or cycling friendliness of different cities in the United States.
            </p>
        <h3>About the charts:</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Donut chart:</b> I picked this chart as it was a simple yet effective way to show the proportions of residents taking
                different modes of transportation to work.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Line chart:</b> To show the change in ridership over time, a line chart was most effective to identify a trend in ridership.
                I chose to present the different lines in different colors to better convey the distinct categories they represented,
                and used the tooltip to show exact values for individual years as it may be difficult to trace the y-axis lines across the
                chart to estimate a value.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Choropleths:</b> A choropleth was most ideal to examine the geographical distribution of various measures as it
                allowed me to use colors to indicate variation in continuous measures.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Bar chart:</b> I used a bar chart to compare two types of proportions: % of Chicago population,
                and % that take public transportation. Doing so helped convey the message of over-representation in particular groups
                in usage of public transportation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Colors:</b> In general, I made sure to check that the contrast of colors used against the white background of the
                page was high enough. In particular, I used colors that had a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for the charts.
            </p>
        <h3>Coding challenges:</h3>
            <p>
                One challenge I faced was factoring repeated code into reusable dry functions.
                In particular, the code to create the choropleth was difficult to refactor as there were some parts in the
                code which were highly customized to the particular choropleth and due to insufficient time, I was unable to work
                out how to extract these particularities as parameters to a function.
            </p>
