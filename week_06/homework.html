        <h1>Number of People Shot by Police, by Race</h1>
        <p>
            This bar chart shows the breakdown of race amongst the people shot by police in 2015.
            I picked this chart type as it is easy to view the differences in count across race group.
            I also included the percentage of each race group out of the total number of people shot by
            police.
            However, this is not a complete depiction of reality. It would be more accurate to show the
            percentage of people shot out of the total population in each race group. Using population
            statistics would reflect this better.
            Additionally, there is a sizeable proportion of people (7.42%) whose race is unknown.

        <h1>Proportion with Mental Illness</h1>
        <p>
            This donut chart shows the proportion of people shot by the police who had mental illness.
            I picked this chart because there are only two categories to be
            represented, and so there would not be difficulty viewing the labels of each
            category. It might be more helpful to know if signs of mental illness were visible or observed
            by the police officers who shot the persons with mental illness, to dig deeper into
            understanding better the thought process of these officers when deciding to shoot such persons.

        <h1>Proportion of People Armed By State</h1>
        <p>
            This stacked horizontal bar chart shows the number of people who were armed,
            organized by state. I picked this chart as it not only shows the breakdown
            of people who were armed in each state, but also allows us to compare the
            overall number of people shot in each state.
            To simplify the data, I assumed that any person
            who was not labelled as "unarmed" or with no label, was armed. This may
            not have been the best decision as it is not clear why there are empty strings
            for a sizeable number of cases. Additionally, I did not break down the types
            of weapons in possession of those who were armed, and these vary greatly, including:
            gun, chain, blunt object and screwdriver.
            We see that California had by far the highest overall number of people shot by
            the police. A more accurate visualization would be to show the per capita
            number of people shot, as the population of California is more than 30% larger than
            that of Texas, so they are not comparable.
            Nevertheless, another observation we can make from the chart is that in most states,
            more armed persons were shot by police than unarmed persons. This could be clearer had I included
            tooltips or labels to more clearly view the proportion of armed persons in each state.
