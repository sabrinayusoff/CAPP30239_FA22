# Data for Final Project

### Data Source
Title: American Time Use Survey
Agency: US Bureau of Labor Statistics
Location: United States
Link: https://www.bls.gov/tus/database.htm

### Description of Data
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) provides nationally representative estimates of how, where, and with whom Americans spend their time, and is the only federal survey providing data on the full range of nonmarket activities, from childcare to volunteering. This is a primary data source as it comes directly from
the ATUS.

### Interest in Topic & Use of Data
I am interested in understanding how Americans' days are spent on various activities including sleeping, working, and household activities.
I hope to use the data to create a visual representation of a typical day in an average American person's life.
In particular, the data covers a long period from 2003 to 2021, offering insight into how time use has changed over almost two decades.

### Potential Data Points
The potentially more interesting categories in this data set are:
- sleeping - since the number of hours spent sleeping is an important part of one's mental and physical wellbeing, it would be interesting
to see how much time is spent on it
- housework (by gender) - it would be interesting to examine the differences in time spent on housework between men and women,
and whether this has evolved over time
- working - changes in how much time is spent at work is also interesting from the perspective of changing attitudes of employees towards work

### Concerns about the data
2020 values are missing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since data collection was suspended in 2020 from mid-March to mid-May, annual 2020 estimates cannot be produced due to the 2-month suspension in data collection, and thus the ATUS Database was not updated with 2020 data.

There are many more measures in the ATUS that could be examined that are not included here. It might be good to explore these other measures.
Additionally, I might also want to add to this dataset by comparing American Time Use to other countries', as it would
offer great insight into cultural and national differences in time use.
